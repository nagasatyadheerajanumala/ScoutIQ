- **$250K - $750K**: +5 points (mid-market sweet spot)
- **Over $750K**: -10 points (high-value, higher risk)

### Property Age Adjustments:
- **0-4 years**: +10 points (new construction)
- **5-20 years**: +20 points (prime age)
- **Over 40 years**: -15 points (potential maintenance issues)

### Ownership Adjustments:
- **Individual**: +5 points
- **LLC/Corporation**: +10 points (professional investment)

### Risk Adjustments:
- **Low flood risk**: +10 points
- **Medium flood risk**: -10 points
- **High flood risk**: -20 points

### Classification Logic:
- **Score ≥ 70**: Buy (Confidence: 75-95%)
- **Score 50-69**: Hold (Confidence: 60-74%)
- **Score < 50**: Watch (Confidence: 50-59%)
